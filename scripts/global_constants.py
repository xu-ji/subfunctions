If you want to run the residual flows density baseline for in_distribution or out_of_distribution:

RESIDUAL_FLOWS_PATH is the path to your copy of https://github.com/xu-ji/residual-flows
This is used by util/methods/explicit_density

RESIDUAL_FLOWS_MODEL_PATH is the path to your trained density model
This is used by the scripts' arguments

Your model must have been produced by the train_img.py script from the xu-ji repo, e.g. 
python train_img.py --data cifar10 --actnorm True --save experiments/cifar10
python train_img.py --data cifar100 --actnorm True --save experiments/cifar100

You can either train models from scratch as above
Or download the cifar10 model from the original residual flows authors and just reformat the file 
with the xu-ji train_img.py script with SAVE_ONLY set to True
